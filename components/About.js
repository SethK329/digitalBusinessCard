            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I am a husband and a father of two young children. I am working to pivot careers into tech, not only to be able to better provide, but also pursue a career that I will find fulfillment in. Having worked as a pest control technician for 10 years, I have extensive knowledge in identifying and eliminating bugs. My analytical and problem solving skills would be useful in any codebase.
