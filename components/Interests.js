            <p>I enjoy spending time with my family the most. When I do have time to myself I build a variety of things, usually with wood. I have built furniture and mallets and a toddler slide and of course a cutting board. I find being able to make things that get used and have a purpose is immensely satisfying. The joy and satisfaction I get from building something that is functional, beautiful, and refined, out of wood is what I feel when building with code too.</p>
